          This past summer, I worked at the NASDAQ Innovation Lab. Working alongside
          five other interns, we developed a prototype full-stack application to monitor fraudulent
          economic activity in sports betting markets. Through the experience, I learned a
          lot about working with people and what it is like to "start a company" from scratch.
          Our project culminated with the team giving a product pitch and demo to the company's CTO.
          In my free time, I worked with the Innovation Lab's Chief Data Scientist to design
          a web crawler that uses reinforcement learning to interpret web pages. Although, I didn't
          have enough time to fully implement the tool, I mention it because I still built a full-stack application,
          was exposed to new machine learning methods, and designed a data acquisition tool that leverages machine learning.

          Over the spring semester, I worked in CSAIL at MIT. In CSAIL, I worked on a project
          to improve DNN training efficiency through methods of data and model parallelism. Through the
          project I was exposed to the TensorFlow and Horovod libraries. I also gained invaluable
          experience in how to efficiently work on a server and disect research papers. Most importantly, I
          learned that my passion for machine learning lies in creating models, and not
          optimizing the software architecture that surrounds them.

          Last IAP, I worked at LiveData Utilities in Cambridge, Boston. There, I built
          software architecture for a Random Forest Regression model that predicts a community's
          electrical consumption based off of weather and date time. My software retrived weather forecasts,
          automated model training and deployment, pipelined input data, and integrated Influx DB to hold model results
          and data. The experience gave me more practice in writing production level software under great mentorship.

          Last summer, I worked at SendFriend in Cambridge, MA. SendFriend is remittance application
          that leverages blockchain to make transactions both cheap and quick. At SendFriend,
          I did a lot of high impact work. For example, on the first day, I was tasked to
          proof-read the company's business plan. Besides that, I developed a demo application user interface
          that was used to pitch to potential investors. Working with a very small team, I learned how
          to work autonomously and to find solutions to new problems I faced on a daily basis.

          Machine learning and/or data science is a field in computer science that
          significantly peaks my interests. More specifically,
          my interests dwell more on the applied than the research side.
          Through my coursework at MIT and internships,
          I have been exposed to a lot of machine learning concepts and models, but
          have never completed a full machine learning project. Nevertheless, I think that
          with my experience, I am more than capable of tackling ml problems and excel
          in this cs field.

    My Journey
  </h2>
  <div id="journey-content">
    <div id='greeting'>Hello,</div>
    <p>
      My name is Pat Stefanou and I am a senior at MIT studying computer science.
      Many fields in computer science interest me. Through my internships at NASDAQ and SendFriend,
      I have become well-versed in web development. Further, by working at CSAIL and LiveData Utilities, I
      was exposed to machine learning and the software architecture around the models.
      This past summer, I also helped a
      co-worker of mine with a project for Ideo Colab's and Coinlist's Hackathon. We sought to build a
      automated market maker for YouTube channels, by leveraging the concept of a bonding curve
      and the Ethereum Blockchain platform. For my contribution, I wrote "Smart Contracts" in Solidity and learned a lot about Ethereum and
      the limitless possibilities that "dapps" provide. <br><br>

      Outside of the classroom, I serve as a captain on MIT's Premier Varsity Water Polo team. As one of, if not, the strongest
      team ever fielded by MIT, we enter at exciting time in our program's history. This
      year, we are on a mission to dethrone perennial Ivy League houses to be the team that
      "makes it out of the east" and earn an automatic berth to the Division 1 NCAA Championships.
      You can follow our season <a href='https://twitter.com/mitwaterpolo?lang=en' target='_blank'>here</a>
      on our Twitter page. <br><br>

      Taking a step back, I hail from Greenwich, CT, where I went to a top-tier prep school called Brunswick.
      It probably comes as no surprise, but I have loved aquatics sports my entire life. When I was

      <img src='./images/throwback.jpg' id='throwback-photo' class='journey-photo'>

      younger, I would spend my summers with my family in Greece, where I would compete
      on my club's (Nautikos Omilos Bouliagmeni) water polo team. Growing up in Connecticut,
      I competed for Greenwich Aquatics and my high school Brunswick. <br><br>

      While playing for 'Aquatics, my team's success was highlighted by an eigth place finish
      at USA Water Polo's Junior Olympics (water polo nationals), an unprecedented
      performance by an east coast team at the time. <br><br>

      At Brunswick, I watched the program grow from a group
      of boys who did not have a fall sport, to <b>the</b> best high school water polo
      team outside of California. In high school, I garnered two New England
      Water Polo Championships and two league MVP awards. This all culminated my senior
      year, when I was named a 2nd Team All-American for my efforts. <br><br>

      <img src='./images/formal.jpg' id='formal-photo' class='journey-photo'>

      To say that I switched
      lanes after high school is an under statement. Throughout high school, I was obsessed
      with languages; reaching the highest course levels in French, Latin, and Ancient Greek studies.
      On graduation, I received <i>The Bouffier Language Prize</i> and was keyed
      "one of most talented linguists" the school ever had. <br><br>

      Classics may have no relation to computer science, but I enjoyed
      translating texts such as <i>The Aeneid</i>, <i>The Iliad</i>, and Caesar's <i>Gallic Wars</i>.
      Further, I believe that my language studies have made me a multi-faceted individual
      and, complemented with my technical background, helps me bring a unique perspective to the table. <br><br>

      Given my background, one can only imagine what I was in for when I arrived at MIT.
      Knowing little to nothing about coding before coming to MIT, there was definitely a steep learning curve
      during the beginning of my undergrad years. It was not always "sunshine and rainbows" at MIT,
      but I have learned tremendous amounts through relentless trial and error. I firmly
      believe that people learn more through failure, and the mistakes I have made in the classroom
      and on the job have sculpted me into a proficient software developer. <br><br>

      When I am not studying or playing sports, you can usually find me in my fraternity on Beacon
      St. I am an active member of Theta Tau, MIT's only professional engineering fraternity.
      Through my time in TT, I have held two house positions. During my sophomore year, I
      served as Tech Chair, where I helped maintain the house's server and website. This fall, I
      will serve as Professional Development Chair, where I will help my brother's navigate
      their careers by giving them advice and guidance through the fall recruiting process. <br><br>

      <img src='./images/the-strokes.png' id='strokes-photo' class='journey-photo'>

      Besides this, I am an avid fan of <i>The Strokes</i>, with my favorite song by them being
      <i>You Only Live Once</i>. I am also extremely excited for this upcoming summer's Olympics
      in Tokyo, where I hope to witness American swimming superstar Caeleb Dressel eclipse Michael Phelp's
      record of winning eight gold medals in a single Olympics and cement his place in history as one of the
      greatest Olympians of all-time. <br><br>

      Moving forward, my main interests in CS lie in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and fintech. I plan to
      pursue these interests when completing my Master's degree at MIT and throughout my career. <br><br>

      If there is one thing, that I would like you to remember about me is that I am a
      hard-worker, a fierce competitor, and someone who cares immensely about his career.
      If you would like a reference about me, please let me know and
      I can connect you with one of my previous employers. <br><br>
